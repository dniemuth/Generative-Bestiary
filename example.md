  "desc": "Elementals, beings of pure energy and matter, are formed when the energy of the Elemental Planes coalesces in the Prime Material plane. Small elementals, such as those presented here, are the most common sort. They can be found anywhere on the Prime Material plane, as long as there is sufficient elemental energy to sustain them. Like their larger cousins, these small elementals enjoy nothing more than interacting and playing with other creatures of a similar nature to their own.",
